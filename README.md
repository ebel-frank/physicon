# ABSTRACT
In response to the 60 Day App Development Challenge by the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, in engaging the innovative minds of young Nigerians in designing mobile applications, I, Frank C. Ebeledike have proposed to solve the problems (lack of collaboration during learning, lack of confidence to approaching exams) relating to education. My strategy is to develop an android application that enables secondary school science students post questions relating to Physics as well as get answers to their questions from other students. The application package also enables students to study and prepare for Physics test and examination.

# BACKGROUND
My app (**Physicon**) is an android based application developed and designed with the sole purpose of helping Senior Secondary School students learn physics through short lessons, quizzes and group discussions. The lessons are brief and informative, enhancing the student to learn Physics. The app also contains a quiz section where the student is asked series of questions relating to Physics which help them discover their strength and weakness, and also identify gaps in their knowledge. Students can ask questions using Physicon and also reply to other students’ questions.

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM
In his book “No man is an island”, John Donne pointed out that no one is self-sufficient; everyone relies on one another. The same applies to learning and this has led me to create an android based application that allows students to collaborate during learning. Thus, students now have an avenue to share ideas and solutions.
In addition, the proposed idea is also intended to address the problem of lack of confidence to approach exams. For most students, their problem with exams is lack of confidence and this in turn can affect that student’s grades. My app (Physicon) encourages and motivates the students by giving them a motivational quote once a day to help them believe in themselves. Furthermore, as the saying goes, “Preparation is key to success”, using Physicon, students can prepare for test and exams, it also contains few topics in physics with very informative content to help better the understanding of students.

# OBJECTIVES
1. To bring about collaboration during learning in the COVID-19 and post COVID-19 era.
2. To enhance confidence to approaching exams among students.
